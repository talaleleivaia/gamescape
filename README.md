 Access the site here: https://tqv-gamescape.herokuapp.com/
 
 The site is basically a place to play some text adventure games. 
It gets the information about the games and the link to the page where you can play the game from an API so as I make more games. I can add those to the API and they will render on the home page.

I used the ink scripting language from [inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) to create the text games.
